The official repository for the osu!bancho Server that powers the [osu!katagiri](https://osu.katagiri.ml) private server. This was built with specifically osu!katagiri in mind, but other use cases may apply. As such, we wont be handling support for its setup or usage.

## Requirements and Prerequisites
* MySQL
* Node.js v14+ (Tested on v15, but v14 should work.)

## Running It
This repository only exists to serve as a public front to the behind-the-scenes work to how Katagiri works; and to provide an open-source footprint for us to follow and preserve. Nonetheless, our licensing states that running instances of Atarashii and other Kuragari instances and projects are fine; but doing such will have no support from our sides. IF you wish to run a provided instance, then we fully trust that you have the capability to run this website if you were capable enough to setup something like PHP or MySQL.

Furthermore, we kindly ask that if you run an instance of this website, that you remove all references to the Katagiri project, and the Kuragari team nigh-entirely. We accept credit for our work on this project, but not the usage of our assets without our permission. Licensing for external assets *used* by this frontend belong to the original creators and developers that made them to begin with.

## Sidenote
The project itself is far from complete, so even if you were to managea to setup your own instance, it won't do much as the core components to an osu! server isn't finished yet at all.

### Special Contributors
